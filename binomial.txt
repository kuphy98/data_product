You are plotting a Binomial Distribution with a random number generator in R. 

In probability theory, the Binomial Distribution is the discrete probability of the number of successes in a sequence of 'n' trials with the success probability. When the number of trial is 1, the binomial distribution is a Bernoulli distribution.
